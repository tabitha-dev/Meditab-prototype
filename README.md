## üí° About This Project

MediTab started as a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) assignment for my Master's program at the University of the People. The goal was to design a solution for the fragmented communication systems in healthcare. I decided to take the concept further and build a fully interactive front-end prototype to bring the design to life.

This project showcases my ability to create a complex, multi-faceted application using only core web technologies. My focus was on creating a clean, modern, and intuitive user interface that is both responsive and accessible, demonstrating strong skills in vanilla JavaScript for state management, DOM manipulation, and interactive components.

## ‚ú® Key Features

MediTab simulates a multi-user environment with four distinct, role-based dashboards:

| Role      | Key Features                                                                                                                                                             |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ü©∫ **Doctor** | View a list of patients, see their status at a glance, and click to view detailed charts and notes. Monitor key patient stats with a pie chart visualization.             |
| ‚ûï **Nurse** | Manage a live task list for patient care. Update the status of tasks (Pending, In Progress, Completed) with interactive dropdowns.                                     |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Manager** | Access a high-level console with KPI cards and data visualizations, including a line chart for weekly task performance and a list of high-priority system alerts.        |
| üë§ **Patient** | Navigate a user-friendly portal to view appointments, lab results, medications, and billing. Includes interactive modals for scheduling and a simulated live chat. |

### Global Features:
* **Role-Based Login:** A mock login screen to switch between different user views.
* **Notification Center:** A global notification system with unread indicators.
* **Dark/Light Mode:** A sleek, modern theme toggle for user preference.
* **Interactive Modals:** Dynamic modals for patient details, appointment scheduling, and live chat.
* **Toast Notifications:** Non-intrusive feedback for user actions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This prototype was built from the ground up to be lightweight and dependency-free, relying on modern browser capabilities.

-   **HTML5:** For semantic structure and content.
-   **CSS3 & Tailwind CSS:** For a utility-first approach to styling and creating a responsive, mobile-first design.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all application logic, including:
    -   State management
    -   Component-based rendering
    -   DOM manipulation
    -   Event handling
-   **Chart.js:** For creating beautiful, interactive data visualizations.
-   **Lucide Icons:** For clean and modern iconography.
